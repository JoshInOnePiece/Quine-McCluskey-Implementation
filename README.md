# Quine-McCluskey-Implementation
By Joshua Joseph and Evan Chang
## Challenges
Test
## Verification
To verify the functionality of our implementation, we designed a test suite of varying different cases. To run the test suite, clone the repo. Then from within the repo, run the command `./testSuite.sh`. Doing so will automatically run 7 tests and compare the results with a validation output. Upon testing, the test suite revealed several bugs which have now been rectified.
